The example in this directory should reproduce the results presented
in Hilton et al. (2012) for the evolution of the X-ray luminosity --
temperature relation from XCSDR1 (Mehrtens et al. 2012).

One tweak has been made compared to the results in Hilton et al. - 
here, a pivot is applied to both the x and y coordinates when doing
the orthogonal regression.

Note that the negative evolution seen in Hilton et al. (2012) is
reduced significantly using the updated temperature and luminosity
pipelines described in Rooney et al. (in prep.)
